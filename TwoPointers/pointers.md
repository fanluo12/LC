## 125. Valid Palindrome
Simply use two pointers left(from head) and right(from tail) to loop forward and backward. 2 things to noted:
1. In while loop to update two pointers, we need to set left <= right since this may deal with odd length palindrome case
2. Built-in function--Character.isLetterOrDigigt to exclude other conditions

## 167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
Since array has been sorted, we use two pointers from head and tail to track if they can sum up target.
In while loop, we need to set left < right since position cannot be overlapped. If result is found, simply break loop and return. If result is less than target, means greater value needed and move forward left pointer. Same to right pointer
